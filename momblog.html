The BEST Holiday Cookies - February 25 2020
</h3>
<p class="mompost">
Ok fellow moms, we all know that our own cookies sometimes don't quite taste the same as our grandparents' when we were younger.
 But I think I've finally cracked the code for all-natural, vegan, glutten-free, non-gmo, fair trade, no-nut, soy-free,
 antibiotic-free, grass-fed, free-range, water-free holiday cookies!!!!!!!
<br><br>
Here's my recipe, good luck mommies of the world!
<br><br>
Ingredients:
<br>
1 cup premium rolled oats
<br>
1/2 cup CDs
<br>
1 tbsp cinnamon
<br>
2 tbsp peppermint essential oil
<br>
1 pair cotton pyjamas
<br>
3 tsp nutmeg
<br>
1/4 tsp nutritional yeast
<br>
1 tsp cloves (Be careful! Cloves pack a punch!)
<br>
1 tsp the crusty stuff on the walls of your dirty microwave (for sweetness)
<br>
1 tsp cardamom (Adds a unique flavour! Would soooooo recommend...)
<br>
1 larynx of the doctor who vaccinated your children, dried and powdered
<br>
1/4 cup axle grease (WOrks great as a natural binder)
<br><br>
Instructions:
<br>
Crush CDs fine into a powder or use a blender. They add a really great bite and crunch, perfect for the holiday season. Next, shred pyjamas into strips
 and mascerate with axle grease to combine. Let the cotton fibres break down in the liquid. Next, combine oats, cinnamon, nutmeg
 yeast, cloves, microwave crust, cardamom and doctor larynx in a bowl, mix well to combine. After 30 minutes, combine dry ingredients with pyjama
 mixture. Mix CDs through and sprinkle in peppermint oil. Adding the oil last preserves its flavour as it can evaporate over time. Bake in a cold oven for 36
 hours until golden-brown and crispy.
