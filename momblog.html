The BEST Holiday Cookies - February 25 2020
</h3>
<p class="mompost">
Ok fellow moms, we all know that our own cookies sometimes don't quite taste the same as our grandparents' when we were younger.
 But I think I've finally cracked the code for all-natural, vegan, glutten-free, non-gmo, fair trade, no-nut, soy-free,
 antibiotic-free, grass-fed, free-range, water-free holiday cookies!!!!!!!
<br>
Here's my recipe, good luck mommies of the world!
<br>
Ingredients:
<br>
1/2 cup crushed CDs
<br>
1 tbsp cinnamon
<br>
2 tbsp peppermint essential oil
<br>
1 pair cotton pyjamas
<br>
3 tsp nutmeg
<br>
1/4 tsp nutritional yeast
<br>
1 tsp cloves (Be careful! Cloves pack a punch!)
<br>
1 tsp the crusty stuff on the walls of your dirty microwave (for sweetness)
<br>
1 tsp cardamom (Adds a unique flavour! Would soooooo recommend...)
<br>
1 larynx of the doctor who vaccinated your children
<br>
1/4 cup axle grease (WOrks great as a natural binder)
