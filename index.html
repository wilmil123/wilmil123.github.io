			9 reasons why scientists should genetically hybridize giraffes and hummingbirds
		</h1>
		<p class="paraiii">
			1. how many spotted yellow birds are there in the world? i think we could use one more
			<br>
			2. does one pair of legs become wings? do wings get added on in addition to legs? do all the legs become wings? 
			we'd be missing out if we didn't know
			<br>
			3. that would be one chunky bird like we're talking a bird the size of a bus, or it could be a really cute tiny
			flying giraffe
			<br>
			4. evolutionarily superior because it doesn't need to reach for leaves anymore it can just fly and get unlimited food
			<br>
			5. i would LOVE to hear the noise that comes out of its mouth (beak?)
			<br>
			6. imagine leaving lemonade outside in the summer and a stampede of monstrous birds with dangly legs and necks come
			crashing through the trees and they start grunt-squawking at each other, fighting over the precious sugar water
			<br>
			7. do they have fur or feathers? i bet they'd be pretty soft and perfect for pillows or something after the birds die or
			something
			<br>
			8. they could theoretically be great pets, like the dog version of a budgie
			<br>
			9. bigger wing surface area = lower pitch hum on hummingbirds, so i want to hear the insane bass coming off this animal
